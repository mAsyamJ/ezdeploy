# EzDeploy 🧱🚀  
**Own, Customize, and Deploy Smart Contracts Onchain in Seconds**

## 🚨 The Problem EzDeploy Solves

The Web3 ecosystem is facing a critical bottleneck: a global shortage of Solidity developers. With only ~30,000 active devs as of 2025—compared to over 27 million software developers worldwide—startups face massive inefficiencies, often spending **$15K+ and 8+ hours** per smart contract deployment (Upwork).

These constraints have led to unsafe practices like copy-pasting unverified code, contributing to **$3.5B+ in hacks (2022–2024)** (Immunefi). Meanwhile, interest in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) like supply chains and real estate has exploded—growing **600% in 2023** (BCG). Yet, **90% of SMEs lack the technical resources** to deploy secure and customized smart contracts.

Without democratizing smart contract deployment, Web3 risks leaving **trillions in value untapped**, with **less than 1%** of the **$326T RWA market** currently onchain.

## 🛠️ How EzDeploy Solves It

### 🧱 No-Code Smart Contract Deployment  
- Deploy OpenZeppelin-based ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and NFT contracts in under **5 minutes**  
- Cut initial development costs by **up to 90%**  
- Enables non-devs (e.g., a coffee farmer) to tokenize assets without writing code  
- Real-world example: [ERC-20 token deployed via EzDeploy](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xF57233D6cD049045551596c27f4bb1cc72Faaf86#code)

### 🤖 AI-Guided Customization (powered by Ohara AI)  
- Convert natural language like “Make a token with 5% tax” into optimized Solidity  
- Reduce code errors by **70%** through filtered, prompt-trained generation  
- Supports complex logic (e.g., tax exemption, burn rates)  
- Outperforms rigid builders like Thirdweb by dynamically adapting to user needs  

### 🏗️ Industry-Focused Templates  
- Modules tailored for **fractional real estate**, **supply chain tokenization**, and **RWA** applications  
- Designed for **SMEs and builders** who need secure deployment without hiring Solidity engineers

## 🔍 Walkthrough  

1. Describe your smart contract in plain language (e.g. “Create NFT collection with 1000 supply and 5% royalty”).  
2. Ohara AI parses the prompt and generates a secure, optimized contract.  
3. Preview the contract logic in the code editor (based on OpenZeppelin standards).  
4. Click **Deploy** — we use Thirdweb CLI + SDK to publish it onchain.  
5. After deployment, go to the **Dashboard** to monitor your contract.  
6. View contract live on-chain:

## ⚔️ Challenges We Faced

### 🧠 Ohara AI Integration  
Initially, building all frontend/backend/AI logic together broke the app repeatedly (“sandbox not found” errors). We pivoted to build backend logic first and scale complexity step-by-step.

### 🔐 Faulty Solidity Logic  
Ohara’s early outputs were often invalid. We trained it on OpenZeppelin and added filters to block unsafe code patterns, raising compile success rates from **60% → 95%**.

### 🧩 Thirdweb SDK Mismatches  
The AI used outdated syntax. We built wrappers and prompt-injected the correct patterns via Ohara to stabilize deployments.

### ⛽ Gas Inefficiency  
Initial contracts consumed excessive gas. We added **Ethers.js** estimators and introduced a **“Gas Saver Mode”**, cutting mint costs by over **50%**.

### 🔗 BASE Compatibility  
We forked Ohara SDK, added `.base` support and RPCs, embedded OnchainKit, and integrated directly with Thirdweb CLI for seamless Base chain deployment.

## 🔬 Tracks Applied

### ✅ AI Track  
EzDeploy is fundamentally AI-driven. Using Ohara’s model, it translates natural language into secure Solidity logic and adapts to developer intent.

### ✅ Vibe Coding Track  
EzDeploy was built fast and creatively using Ohara's prompt coding style. Despite AI limitations, we shipped a functional tool that simplifies complex blockchain deployment for non-devs and devs alike.
